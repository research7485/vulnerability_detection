The product filters data in a way that causes it to be reduced or collapsed into an unsafe value that violates an expected security property.
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete, leading to resultant weaknesses.
A regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.
The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.
The product stores a password in a configuration file that might be accessible to actors who do not know the password.
Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.
The product does not have a mechanism in place for managing password aging.
The product supports password aging, but the expiration period is too long.

A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.
Two distinct privileges, roles, capabilities, or rights can be combined in a way that allows an entity to perform unsafe actions that would not be allowed without that combination.
The product does not properly manage privileges while it is switching between different contexts that have different privileges or spheres of control.

The product does not properly verify that a critical resource is owned by the proper entity.
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.
Simple authentication protocols are subject to reflection attacks if a malicious user can use the target machine to impersonate a trusted user.
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.
The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.
The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.
The product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.
The use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of compromise when compared with the benefits of a dual-factor authentication scheme.
The use of password systems as the primary means of authentication may be subject to several flaws or shortcomings, each reducing the effectiveness of the mechanism.
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.
Nonces should be used for the present occasion and only once.
The product uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.
The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).
The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.
The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.

The product uses a transmission protocol that does not include a mechanism for verifying the integrity of the data during transmission, such as a checksum.
The product does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or checksums of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.
The product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user. This makes it easier for attackers to trick users into inflicting damage to their system.
The user interface provides a warning to a user regarding dangerous or sensitive operations, but the warning is not noticeable enough to warrant attention.
The product does not implement or incorrectly implements one or more security-relevant checks as specified by the design of a standardized algorithm, protocol, or technique.
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.
Security based on event locations are insecure and can be spoofed.
The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.
A product performs a series of non-atomic actions to switch between contexts that cross privilege or other security boundaries, but a race condition allows an attacker to modify or misrepresent the product's behavior during the switch.
The product divides a value by zero.
The product does not properly determine which state it is in, causing it to assume it is in state X when in fact it is in state Y, causing it to perform incorrect operations in a security-relevant manner.
The product sends non-cloned mutable data as an argument to a method or function.
Sending non-cloned mutable data as a return value may result in that data being altered or deleted by the calling function.
Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.
The product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.
Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.
A constant symbolic reference to an object is used, even though the reference can resolve to a different object over time.
The product detects a specific error, but takes no actions to handle the error.
[PLANNED FOR DEPRECATION. SEE MAINTENANCE NOTES AND CONSIDER CWE-252, CWE-248, OR CWE-1069.] Ignoring exceptions and other error conditions may allow an attacker to induce unexpected behavior unnoticed.
The product encounters an error but does not provide a status code or return value to indicate that an error has occurred.
A function or operation returns an incorrect return value or status code that does not indicate an error, but causes the product to modify its behavior based on the incorrect result.
The product does not properly check when a function or operation returns a value that is legitimate for the function, but is not expected by the product.
Catching NullPointerException should not be used as an alternative to programmatic checks to prevent dereferencing a null pointer.
Catching overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.
Throwing overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.

The accidental deletion of a data-structure sentinel can cause serious programming logic problems.
The accidental addition of a data-structure sentinel can cause serious programming logic problems.

The product contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original password, but the mechanism is weak.
The product constructs the name of a file or other resource using input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the resulting name.
The product contains an account lockout protection mechanism, but the mechanism is too restrictive and can be triggered too easily, which allows attackers to deny service to legitimate users by causing their accounts to be locked out.
